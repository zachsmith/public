> Life is long enough, and a sufficiently generous amount has been given to us
> for the highest achievements if it were all well invested. But when it is
> wasted in heedless luxury and spent on no good activity, we are forced at
> last by deathâ€™s final constraint to realize that it has passed away before we
> knew it was passing. So it is: we are not given a short life but we make it

> wealth however modest, if entrusted to a good custodian, increases with use,
> so our lifetime extends amply if you mange it properly." - **Seneca, _[On The
