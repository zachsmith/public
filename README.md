# Zachary Smith’s /public Self

There is where I attempt to keep a record of me and my thoughts about the world. The idea for creating my own `/public` came from Buster Benson who created a [/public][1] and a Codex Vitae. Thanks, Buster!

## The Codex

[My Codex Vitae _(Book of Life)_][2]

## The Lists

[Books & papers I’ve read][3]

## /now

[What am I doing now?][4]
