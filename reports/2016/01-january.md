## Monthly: January, 2016

January was a month of beginning to get things back into focus. Started the
year off with a lot of project ideas floating around and trying to put aside
time to make progress on them all to see where some momentum would come from.
I’m launching a new company this week that is going to be doing some consulting
work and looking forward to my first contract starting in a few weeks. I rode
my bike outside for the first time in months which was pretty nice. Still not
interested in riding in the cold and wet so was happy to find a mild and sunny
Sunday to roll around the south end of Lake Washington.

Starting to kick around a book idea so we’ll see how far I get with that.
Outlining and investigating a few research areas where I think there are
interesting intersections to combine into something. Hopefully more news on
that in months to come…
