## Monthly: February, 2016

Things really picked up in February. I formed a company with a partner at the end of January and have been busy working on getting things organized and generating some momentum. The company is called Catalyz and we’re busy creating marketing materials and starting to take sales calls and bid on projects. Our first client project is starting the first week of March (next week) and we are receiving a lot of interest in the services we’re designing.

I’m still “flaring” on topics to pull into my book idea and have been experimenting with ways to manage and organize the research I collect. I was inspired by writer Dustin Lance Black’s method which he describes in [this short video](http://zxmth.us/1oHD88Y). I also spoke with author Ryan Holiday briefly this month and he described a similar process that leverages note cards. I also bought a calendar to incorporate [Jerry Seinfeld’s calendar technique](http://zxmth.us/1oHDkVI) late last month but haven’t really identified exactly what the _X_ should be for each day.

I went to [Re:Think Decision Making](http://zxmth.us/1OFxERf) at the end of February. It was my fourth [Farnam Street Re:Think event](http://rethinkworkshops.com/) and my second time at Re:Think Decision Making. I love these events. Re:Think events provide the types of environments I thrive on. While I didn’t learn as much from this event as events past (probably in part because I spent so much of last year studying what I was exposed to at last February’s event), I find these events to be mentally invigorating and I always enjoy spending time with the people I meet there.

**Family**

- Tuesday has started to talk more about colleges she is interested in. This is exciting…and a little daunting. She is taking an ACT prep class and considering doing Running Start for her senior year. She is still volunteering at the Seattle Art Museum on Thursday’s as part of the _Teen Art Group_ and has a pretty packed babysitting schedule.
- Alex’s month started out a bit more relaxed than it tends to be but she is starting to get busy again. She is most excited this month about expanding her team with some really high-potential new associates she is hiring. These new team members will help her continue to grow her practice.
- Ann is coming to visit this month. It has been over a year since her last visit and I’m excited to spend some time with her in Seattle.
- Everybody in good health
